ðŸ©º Medical Insurance Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting *medical insurance charges* using various machine learning regression models. It uses real-world healthcare data to build predictive models based on a person's demographics and lifestyle habits. The goal is to create a cost-estimation system that can be useful for individuals, insurance companies, or health policy planners.



 ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Medical insurance charges depend on multiple factors like age, BMI, gender, number of children, smoking habit, and region.  
This project builds a predictive model that estimates how much medical insurance cost a person may incur, based on such features.
